# VRE Planetology

This repository aims to gather application requirements for setting up a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) dedicated to planetology. We invite contributions to establish a comprehensive list of necessary packages and tools.

## What is a Virtual Research Environment (VRE)?

A Virtual Research Environment (VRE) is a digital platform that integrates various software tools, datasets, and computing resources into a unified workspace tailored for research purposes. It provides researchers with collaborative tools, data management capabilities, and computational tools necessary to conduct and facilitate scientific investigations.

In the context of planetology, a VRE can offer specialized tools for analyzing planetary data, modeling planetary processes, and simulating geological phenomena. It allows researchers to collaborate remotely, share datasets securely, and perform complex analyses efficiently within a controlled environment.
